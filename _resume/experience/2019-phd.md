Under the supervision of Pierre-Alain Fouque and Mohamed Sabt.

Research of vulnerabilities in deployed cryptographic implementations: detect, exploit, patch.
Centered on attacking Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)
protocols using microarchitectural side channels. Contributions include:
* Attack on SRP, using Flush+Reload to exploit insecure arithmetic and
efficiently recover passwords (published at **CCS 2021**)
* Attack on Dragonfly (WPA3), using Flush+Reload to recover passwords
(published at **ACSAC 2020**). A second attack leveraging insecure calls
to third-party libraries to exploit a prefetching-based side channel and
recover passwords (in submission).
* Formally verified implementation (secret-independence and memory
safe) of Dragonfly using HACL* (in submission)
* Study of constant-time verification tools usage by developers
(published at **S&P 2022**) and usability (study in progress).
* Analysis and attack on the smartcard communication protocol SCP10
from GlobalPlatform (published at **TCHES 2020**)
