I started my PhD in October 2019, under the supervision of [Pierre-Alain FOUQUE](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/) and [Mohamed SABT](http://people.irisa.fr/Mohamed.Sabt/) in the [SPICY](https://spicy.irisa.fr/) team (former EMSEC) at IRISA in Rennes.

My research focuses on vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations, which can be related to the core protocol (if there is an issue in the specification) or implementation-specific (side channels or any information leak). The goal of my PhD is to outline the practicability of such vulnerabilities by implementing attacks in a real-world scenario.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from [Rennes 1's Cryptography Master](https://formations.univ-rennes1.fr/master-mention-mathematiques-et-applications-parcours-mathematiques-de-linformation-cryptographie) in 2018, where I acquired the mathematical background needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of cryptography. Then, I worked one year at [Amossys](https://www.amossys.fr/) (Rennes, France) as a Security Analyst, where I could get my hands on some real-world crypto implementations. It also pushed me to enlarge my CS knowledge and develop more practical skills.
